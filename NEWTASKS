These tasks are intended for coders just starting out with TAEB development.

* Write new Actions (which are an abstraction of NetHack commands). In
  increasing order of difficulty:
      e(x)change weapons
      (r)ead scroll/spellbook/fortune cookie
      (z)ap wand (don't forget to handle direction)
      (w)ear armor
      (o)pen doors/chests/etc

* Enhance skills. This one isn't too hard, and will be useful. You'll want:
  - an Enhance action
  - a msg_can_enhance (there are three or four different messages for this)
  - an Enhance behavior which waits for msg_can_enhance
  - bonus points for asking the personality about each skill to enhance
