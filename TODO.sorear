- Explore optimization

  - Track what squares need to be explored, only run Explore if there are any

  - Should give -1 pathfind during boring ops (CurseCheck most notably)


- Carrion

  - When we get a message of "You kill the (.*)!" etc, generate a
    msg_fresh_meat with $1

  - The tile which had such a monster adds to ->kills with that monster
    (as always, older kills take precedence)

  - When a tile is examined or seen to be empty, ->kills is purged of
    obsolete (no corpses!) kills, ->corpses is created from scratch with
    TAEB::World::Item::Corpse objects (which know a max age)

  - TAEB::AI::Behavior::Carrion looks for tiles with nice ->corpses to eat -
    anything nutritious and unrotten if we are somewhat hungry, also look
    for intrinsics

  - This falls over if stuff dies out of LOS and we don't find (stray corpses
    add as kills with -1000 time) the corpse before killing the same type of
    monster on top.  As long as this is a corner case, Tyr can deal.  Else
    consider not eating corpses on traps.


- Smarter searching (mostly done)

  - Should move code into T:A:B:Search for performance/factoring

  - Don't search walls we can path around (requires getting the whole tree
    from dijkstra)


- Armour swapping

  - It's just a pathfinding problem.  Vertices are 53-bit strings representing
    which items are worn... try to find the "best" reachable state.

  - If you are at the best reachable state, drop unworn armour

  - Pick up armour if you are at the best reachable state, but wouldn't be if
    you had this in inventory (hence 53).  Works best if UpgradeArmour >
    GetItems.
