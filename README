TAEB is a modular NetHack bot + framework.

All of its NetHack-playing logic is in lib/TAEB/AI/. The framework is the rest
of lib/. For example, lib/TAEB/Knowledge/ includes data about NetHack's
monsters, items, etc.

AI is currently broken into two parts, Behaviors and Personalities. Behaviors
are small objects that are slightly higher level individual actions, such as
"FixHunger". Personalities make use of Behaviors and ultimately decide which
one is run next.
