TAEB is a modular NetHack framework.

The framework is ultimately in control of everything. Each turn it just
asks the AI for an action to run. Any prompts or menus are handled
through the use of callbacks. This divide made it easy to add a web
interface in a day's work.


-- GETTING TAEB

Download "http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB.tar.gz" and extract to the
directory of your choice. The rest of instructions assume you are
in this directory.


-- INSTALLING

If you're on Ubuntu, you'll first need to install the "build-essential"
and "libncurses5-dev" packages.

Warning: TAEB makes heavy use of CPAN.

$ perl Makefile.PL

Answer the defaults to any dependencies it asks about. You may have to
set up CPAN. The defaults are usually fine. Be sure to set a mirror
though.

$ sudo make installdeps

This will install the modules from CPAN. TAEB's dependencies themselves
usually have a few dependencies. All in all you're probably looking at
about 50 modules.

After this, another module needs to be installed. It is not on CPAN, so
must fetch it from "http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB-AI-Behavioral.tar.gz".
Extract, change to the directory, and do:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make test          # this will build and test the module
$ sudo make install


-- CONFIGURING

Now it's time to set up TAEB for running on nethack.alt.org. First,
create a new account. Paste the contents of etc/TAEB.nethackrc into
the account's rcfile.

Then, in vim (and only vim; I'll know if you used emacs), edit the
(nonexistent) etc/site_config.yml config file. Here's where you set your
account's name and password. The format is:

interface: Telnet
interface_options:
  Telnet:
      account: MyTAEB
      password: secretsauce

Then you should be ready to run him! Type perl bin/taeb and cross your
fingers.

If you want to run TAEB on your machine, you need to have nethack
installed.  No patches to nethack are required.
