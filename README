TAEB is a modular NetHack framework.

The framework is ultimately in control of everything. Each turn it just
asks the AI for an action to run. Any prompts or menus are handled
through the use of callbacks. This divide made it easy to add a web
interface in a day's work.


-- GETTING TAEB

The preferred method for obtaining the TAEB source is from the darcs repo:
    darcs get http://sartak.org/code/TAEB/
Alternatively, you can download "http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB.tar.gz" and
extract to the directory of your choice. The rest of instructions assume you
are in this directory.

Alternatively, if you want to get the version controlled version,
you can use the following command. This way it'll be easier to keep
in sync with development.

    darcs get http://sartak.org/code/TAEB


-- INSTALLING

If you're on Ubuntu, you'll first need to install the "build-essential"
(for make) and "libncurses5-dev" (for the Curses library) packages.

Warning: TAEB makes heavy use of CPAN.

$ perl Makefile.PL

Answer the defaults to any dependencies it asks about. You may have to
set up CPAN. The defaults are usually fine. Be sure to set a mirror though.

$ make && sudo make install

This will install the modules from CPAN. TAEB's dependencies themselves
usually have a few dependencies. All in all you're probably looking at
about 60 modules.

After this, an AI module needs to be installed. AI modules are not yet on CPAN,
so fetch the most actively developed AI from
http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB-AI-Behavioral.tar.gz (or if you're using darcs, run
darcs get http://sartak.org/code/TAEB-AI-Behavioral). Extract, change to the
directory, and do:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make test          # this will build and test the module
$ sudo make install


-- CONFIGURING

TAEB ships with a very basic configuration file in etc/config.yml.
Configuration files are written in YAML (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml).
The default configuration just enables the Local interface (which runs TAEB on
a locally installed copy of NetHack, no patches are required) and the Demo AI,
but many other elements of TAEB are also configurable - read the comments in
etc/config.yml for more details.

The first step is to create a directory for TAEB to use for reading
configuration and storing state and log files. By default, this directory is
~/.taeb, but this can by overridden by setting the TAEBDIR environment
variable. Copy the configuration file into that directory.

Next, TAEB requires certain options to be set in order to recognize dungeon
features, and to not get confused by extra output. These options are in
etc/TAEB.nethackrc. For the Local interface, copy this file into $TAEBDIR. To
play on a DGameLaunch server such as nethack.alt.org, use the Telnet interface,
and copy the nethackrc into the configuration editor.


-- RUNNING TAEB

Then you should be ready to run him! Type taeb and cross your fingers.

TAEB itself ships with only a very basic set of AIs - Demo is a very barebones
example AI, and Human and Quit are both mostly for testing. The most fully
featured AI at the moment is the Behavioral AI, which can be obtained either by
"darcs get http://sartak.org/code/TAEB-AI-Behavioral", or by downloading and
extracting http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB-AI/Behavioral.tar.gz. Follow that
module's README to finish the installation process.
