TAEB is a modular NetHack framework.

The framework is ultimately in control of everything. Each turn it just asks
the AI for an action to run. Any prompts or menus are handled through the use
of callbacks. This divide made it easy to add a web interface in a day's work.


-- INSTALLING

If you're on Ubuntu, you'll first need to install the "build-essential" and
"libncurses5-dev" packages.

Warning: TAEB makes heavy use of CPAN.

$ perl Makefile.PL

Answer the defaults to any dependencies it asks about. You may have to set up
CPAN. The defaults are usually fine. Be sure to set a mirror though.

$ sudo make installdeps

This will install the modules from CPAN. TAEB's dependencies themselves usually
have a few dependencies. All in all you're probably looking at about 50 modules.


-- CONFIGURING

Now it's time to set up TAEB for running on nethack.alt.org. First, create a
new account. Paste the contents of etc/TAEB.nethackrc into the account's
rcfile.

Then, in vim (and only vim; I'll know if you used emacs), edit the
(nonexistent) etc/site_config.yml config file. Here's where you set your
account's name and password. The format is:

---
interface: Telnet
interface_options:
    Telnet:
        account: MyTAEB
        password: secretsauce

Be sure to include the three dashes.

Then you should be ready to run him! Type perl bin/taeb and cross your fingers.

If you want to run TAEB on your machine, you need to have nethack installed.
No patches to nethack are required.
