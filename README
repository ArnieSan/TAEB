TAEB is a modular NetHack framework.

The framework is ultimately in control of everything. Each turn it just
asks the AI for an action to run. Any prompts or menus are handled
through the use of callbacks. This divide made it easy to add a web
interface in a day's work.


-- GETTING TAEB

The preferred method for obtaining the TAEB source is from the darcs repo:
    darcs get http://sartak.org/code/TAEB/
Alternatively, you can download "http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB.tar.gz" and
extract to the directory of your choice. The rest of the instructions assume
you are in this directory.

Downloading the tarball means less work up front (no need to install darcs),
but it'll be more work every time you want to update.


-- INSTALLING

If you're on Ubuntu, you'll first need to install the "build-essential"
(for make) and "libncurses5-dev" (for the Curses library) packages.

Warning: TAEB makes heavy use of CPAN.

$ perl Makefile.PL

Answer the defaults to any dependencies it asks about. You may have to
set up CPAN. The defaults are usually fine. Be sure to set a mirror though.

$ make && sudo make install

This will install the modules from CPAN. TAEB's dependencies themselves
usually have a few dependencies. All in all you're probably looking at
about 60 modules.

After this, an AI module needs to be installed. AI modules are not yet on CPAN,
so fetch the most actively developed AI from
http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB-AI-Behavioral.tar.gz (or if you're using darcs, run
darcs get http://sartak.org/code/TAEB-AI-Behavioral). Extract, change to the
directory, and do:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make test          # this will build and test the AI module
$ sudo make install


-- CONFIGURING

TAEB ships with a very basic configuration file in etc/config.yml.
Configuration files are written in YAML (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml).
The default configuration just enables the Local interface (which runs TAEB on
a locally installed copy of NetHack, no patches are required) and the Demo AI,
but many other elements of TAEB are also configurable - read the comments in
etc/config.yml for more details.

The first step is to create a directory for TAEB to use for reading
configuration and storing state and log files. By default, this directory is
~/.taeb, but this can by overridden by setting the TAEBDIR environment
variable. Copy the configuration file into that directory.

Next, TAEB requires certain options to be set in order to recognize
dungeon features, and to not get confused by extra output. These options
can be displayed by running "taeb --rc". For the Local interface, these will
automatically be copied into $TAEBDIR/TAEB.nethackrc for use by TAEB. To
play on a DGameLaunch server such as nethack.alt.org, use the Telnet
interface, and copy the nethackrc into the configuration editor.


-- RUNNING TAEB

Then you should be ready to run him! Type taeb and cross your fingers.
