Hiveminder is a web 2.0 todo tracking thingy that Eidolos gets paid to work on.

I'm trying to get people to use it for TAEB.

There's a TAEB group, you need an invititation into it though.

There are a few tiny Hiveminder scripts in bin/hm-*. To run them you need
Net::Hiveminder. They are:

    hm-braindump
        Create new tasks from stdin, one per line. You can also specify
        arguments to apply some filters to the entire task list you're creating.
        For example:
            ./bin/hm-braindump owner sartak@bestpractical.com
            foo
            bar
            baz [due tomorrow]
        will create three tasks *for me*

    hm-create
        Create a single task, given on the command line. For example:
            ./bin/hm-create Write the new frobnitz class

    hm-todo
        See what TAEB-related tasks you have coming up

    hm-done
        Mark a list of tasks as complete

    hm-sync
    hm-up
    hm-down
        These will let you do a todo.txt-style interaction with Hiveminder.
        hm-up uploads tasks to Hiveminder, hm-down downloads tasks, and hm-sync
        will do both.
