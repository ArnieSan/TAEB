Everyone is free to add and claim things from this file.

Before 0.01 release:
    - fix --loop bugs
    - TAEB.pm documentation
    - Make sure README is up to date with config, AI, installation instructions
    - Running "taeb" with no taebdir *should* work
      - I believe all that's left is populating config.yml

After 0.01 release:
    - Configurable botl
    - Map keystrokes to actions (for an Interhack-like interface)
    - Announcements
    - netcat commits to NHBot
      - Probably a subclass of Darcs::Notify
    - Move the spells attribute from TAEB to.. dungeon?
    - Move the new_game attribute to Senses
    - Make TAEB::Debug more pluggable
