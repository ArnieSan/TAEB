TAEB has a number of debug commands. While he's playing, you can just type them
in.

If you're using the Human personality, go into debug-command-mode with ~. This
is for the greater good, trust me. :)

TAEB's debug commands follow. If you have any ideas for more commands, please
share.

~
    Open up a REPL. You can do things like:
        Take control:
            TAEB->personality("human")
        Query TAEB's stats:
            TAEB->hp
            TAEB->maxhp
        See the urgency of a particular behavior:
            TAEB->personality->behaviors->{GetItems}->prepare

;
    Look around the map. Works a lot like NetHack's ; command. The 'g' is for
    'glyph' and the 'f' is for 'floor_glyph'. Eventually this will let you
    go to different levels with > and <.

r
    This used to reload his code. But it's not perfect, and doesn't play well
    with Moose's make_immutable, so it's dropped for now.

p
    Pause TAEB until you type any other key. Note that the key you type will
    be totally ignored. This often screws me up because I expect it to be
    a debug command. :)

s
    Turn on single-step mode which will automatically pause after each turn.

i
    Turn on "info-to-screen" mode. This is an obnoxious setting, but interesting
    I guess. Any TAEB->info calls will be logged to TAEB's screen. Normally
    only errors and crits are logged to the screen.

Esc
    Send the next keystroke to NetHack directly. If you need to do multiple
    keystrokes, switch to the Human personality.

q
    Makes TAEB save and exit at the next command. Slightly better than ^C.

Q
    Makes TAEB quit the current game, immediately.

^R
    Redraws the screen (and tries to unscroll the terminal and other stuff)

d
    This command will toggle the draw_debug option which will color things in
    different colors.
        path          => magenta
        interesting   => red
        searched      => cyan
        stepped on    => brown
        explored      => green
        branch stair  => yellow (bold brown)
        shop          => light green (taeb currently ignores shop items)
        traps         => light blue
        Doors:
            shop      => red
            locked    => yellow (bold brown)
            unlocked  => green
