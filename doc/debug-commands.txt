TAEB has a number of debug commands. While he's playing, you can just type them
in.

If you're using the Human AI, go into debug-command-mode with ~. This
is for the greater good, trust me. :)

TAEB's debug commands follow. If you have any ideas for more commands, please
share.

~
    Open up a REPL. You can do things like:
        Take control:
            TAEB->ai("human")
        Query TAEB's stats:
            TAEB->hp
            TAEB->maxhp

;
    Look around the map. Works a lot like NetHack's ; command. The 'g' is for
    'glyph' and the 'f' is for 'floor_glyph'. Eventually this will let you
    go to different levels with > and <.

r
    This used to reload his code. But it's not perfect, and doesn't play well
    with Moose's make_immutable, so it's dropped for now.

p
    Pause TAEB until you type any other key. Note that the key you type will
    be totally ignored. This often screws me up because I expect it to be
    a debug command. :)

s
    Turn on single-step mode which will automatically pause after each turn.

f
    Toggles between floor and glyph display modes.

i
    Turn on "info-to-screen" mode. This is an obnoxious setting, but interesting
    I guess. Any TAEB->info calls will be logged to TAEB's screen. Normally
    only errors and crits are logged to the screen.

Esc
    Send the next keystroke to NetHack directly. If you need to do multiple
    keystrokes, switch to the Human AI.

q
    Makes TAEB save and exit at the next command. Slightly better than ^C.

Q
    Makes TAEB quit the current game, immediately.

^R
    Redraws the screen (and tries to unscroll the terminal and other stuff)

d
    This command will cycle between the screen drawing options.
    The options in the cycle are:

    draw_normal => Draws the screen normally

    draw_debug  => Draws the screen with general debug coloring
        path          => magenta
        enemy         => orange (bold red)
        interesting   => red
        searched      => cyan
        stepped on    => brown
        explored      => green
        branch stair  => yellow (bold brown)
        shop          => light green (taeb currently ignores shop items)
        temple        => light green
        traps         => light blue
        Doors:
            shop      => red
            locked    => yellow (bold brown)
            unlocked  => green

    draw_pathfind => Give detailed information about the pathfinding done each
                     step, as well as coloring of tiles according to number of
                     pathfinds through them.
        1  pathfind    => red
        2  pathfinds   => brown
        3  pathfinds   => green
        4+ pathfinds   => magenta
