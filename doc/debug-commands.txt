TAEB has a number of debug commands. While he's playing, you can just type them
in.

If you're using the Human personality, go into debug-command-mode with ~. This
is for the greater good, trust me. :)

TAEB's debug commands follow. If you have any ideas for more commands, please
share.

    Open up a REPL. You can do things like:
        Take control:
            use TAEB::AI::Personality::Human;
            TAEB->personality(TAEB::AI::Personality::Human->new)
        Query TAEB's stats:
            TAEB->hp
            TAEB->maxhp
        See the urgency of a particular behavior:
            TAEB->personality->behaviors->{GetItems}->prepare

;
    Look around the map. Works a lot like NetHack's ; command. The 'g' is for
    'glyph' and the 'f' is for 'floor_glyph'. Eventually this will let you
    go to different levels with > and <.

r
    Reload his code. Perl doesn't have perfect support for this, but it should
    mostly do the right thing. The first reload doesn't count, it just sets
    the base-line. Which kind of sucks. Typically what I do is:
        Edit some code. Save it.
        Hit 'r'. This does nothing except set the base-line.
        `touch` the files I've changed.
        Hit 'r'. This will now reload the code.
    I'll probably fix this very soon. Like, as soon as I'm done writing this.
    Because I know how!

p
    Pause TAEB until you type any other key. Note that the key you type will
    be totally ignored. This often screws me up because I expect it to be
    a debug command. :)

s
    Turn on single-step mode which will automatically pause after each turn.

i
    Turn on "info-to-screen" mode. This is an obnoxious setting, but interesting
    I guess. Any TAEB->info calls will be logged to TAEB's screen. Normally
    only errors and crits are logged to the screen.

Esc
    Send the next keystroke to NetHack directly. If you need to do multiple
    keystrokes, switch to the Human personality.

q
    Makes TAEB save and exit at the next command. Slightly better than ^C.
